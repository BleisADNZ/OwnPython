These are python scripts to generate Untamed Elephants using images acting as layers to layer up combinations of elephant attributes and generate metadata structured using OpenSea metadata standards.

Each of the scripts serve a purpose, and both asd.py and generate.py are the seme code only that during the coding of the script i tried testing which one was faster to generate using different methods.
